## **Business Activities:**
---
<p>Palantir's software uses data analytics to help companies understand what is facing whether it be customers, supply chain, or competitors. Palantir is an expensive and an long term investment used to solve complex problems so it is geared towards big companies or governments, rather than small to medium sized businesses. Ever since Palantir has shifted towards the private sector, they differ from their competitors by not only providing a platform specific to the company, but also provides on-site engineers to personally supervise the product, similar to a consulting business. The type of applications that Palantir currently uses are NGINX, Bootstrap, Handlebars.js, Plottable.js, Google Analytics, Varnish, and Salesforce.<p>

## **Landscape:**
---
```
The first company that worked with Palantir, once they started targeting the private sector, was JP Morgan Chase & Co. While Palantir's technology could help all domains of finance but the Palantir Foundry Product mainly assists global banks and regulators with potential fraud investigations. As data keeps being collected, Palantir can use big data to help solve problems from fraud to helping design a software can trade using algorithms and data points. We have always used data to review financial data; but as of recently, data combined with computing power, can be used to help buy and sell a stock. Since Palantir is a data analytics and software company, their competitors are other data management or software companies like Cognizant, Splunk, or Tableau.
