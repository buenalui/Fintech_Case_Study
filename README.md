## **Business Activities:**
---
```
Palantir's software uses data analytics to help companies understand what is facing whether it be customers, supply chain, or competitors. Palantir is an expensive and an long term investment used to solve complex problems so it is geared towards big companies or governments, rather than small to medium sized businesses. Ever since Palantir has shifted towards the private sector, they differ from their competitors by not only providing a platform specific to the company, but also provides on-site engineers to personally supervise the product, similar to a consulting business. The type of applications that Palantir currently uses are NGINX, Bootstrap, Handlebars.js, Plottable.js, Google Analytics, Varnish, and Salesforce.

Palantir's technology could help all domains of finance from Payments & Remittances by reducing fraudulent transactions to InsurTech by using data analytics to get a better understanding of their customers.
